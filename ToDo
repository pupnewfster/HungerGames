remove /credits because of the /devs command


replace spectating with spectator gamemode

drop sponsor stuff on ground if inv full


replace timer with bukkit scheduler


force respawn on death?? and also switch to spectator automatically?

keep world spawn as a variable instead of creating location each time

make sure spectating players don't have armor potentially?


Instead of canceling place events and stuff maybe set as adventure??

error messages for commands when they fail

more error message colors, maybe add a logging class to necessities

improve error messages

more lenient args

make commands as their own commands... and have hg command call them?

like ls pause game when no one is on, also probably require min number of players?

special ability items

create a map data structure like ls has and store it in a file

Use minecraft title system for countdown

Use boss bar for player count remaining, should it be /total start or total for map
